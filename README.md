# Age Prediction from ECG Data

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Valladolid University (UVa). The goal of this project is to predict the biological age of a person using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals represented as spectrograms.

## Description

In this project, a **DenseNet121** neural network is used to predict age from ECG data.
