# Age Prediction from ECG Data

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Valladolid University (UVa). The goal of this code is to predict the biological age of a person using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals represented as spectrograms.
All aspects related to the project, as well as the results, are described in the corresponding paper under the name "Predicci√≥n de edad a partir de datos de ECG", available in the UVa repository.

## Description

In this project, a **DenseNet121** neural network is used to predict age from ECG data.

## Requirements
**requirements.txt** contains the necessary libraries. Installation is easily made via:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Weights
Model weights are not available due to size limits on github uploads. They may be shared after contacting the author.
