# Age Prediction from ECG Data

This project was developed as part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Valladolid University (UVa). The goal of this project is to predict the biological age of a person using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals represented as spectrograms. Due to this, everything is described in the corresponding paper under the name "Predicci√≥n de edad a partir de datos de ECG".

## Description

In this project, a **DenseNet121** neural network is used to predict age from ECG data.

## Requirements
**requirements.txt** contains the necessary libraries. Installation is fastly made via:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Weights
Model weights are not available due to size limits. They can be shared by asking the author.
